# 📚 StudyBuddy+: An Ethical AI Math Tutor for Schools & Students

StudyBuddy+ is a web-based educational platform designed to support students, parents, and educators with integrity-driven AI tools. Rather than handing out answers, StudyBuddy+ teaches students **how to solve math problems** through visual, step-by-step guidance, Socratic hinting, and interactive animations — all aligned with Common Core standards.

> ✨ Built by a veteran educator and their daughter as part of a mission to create better, safer educational AI.

## 🎓 Why We Built This

After over 16 years working in special education across multiple classroom settings, the lead developer saw firsthand both the power and the potential pitfalls of emerging AI in schools. Existing AI tools often skip the *learning* and go straight to the *answer* — a serious concern for academic integrity and skill development.

StudyBuddy+ was born out of a desire to **return honor and honesty to the learning process**, giving students the confidence and tools to grow — not just copy.

This project is also a way to pass on the torch: it's co-developed with the creator’s daughter, a college student in Computer Information Systems, to give her hands-on experience in building educational software from the ground up.
