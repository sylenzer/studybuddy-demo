**StudyBuddy+** is a web-based educational platform designed to support students, parents, and educators with integrity-driven AI tools. Rather than handing out answers, StudyBuddy+ teaches students **how to solve math problems** through visual, step-by-step 
guidance, Socratic questioning, and interactive animations — all aligned with Common Core standards.

> ✨ Built by a veteran educator and their daughter as part of a mission to create better, safer educational AI.

## 🎓 Why We Built This

After over 16 years working in special education across various settings, the lead developer recognized the urgent need for AI that promotes *learning*, not just shortcuts. Existing AI tools often give students final answers too easily, compromising academic integrity.

**StudyBuddy+** was created to restore educational values in the age of AI — helping students build confidence and mastery one step at a time. The project also serves as a real-world software experience for the creator’s daughter, a college Computer Information Systems student.
